## Dev environment tips
- ALWAYS prefer the "@tldr" (tldr-mcp_*) tools for code search, structure analysis, and inspection.
- ONLY use the "Grep" tool as a fallback if "tldr-mcp_search" fails to find a specific literal string or if you are searching non-code files.
- Use "tldr-mcp_tree" to understand project structure before using "Glob".
